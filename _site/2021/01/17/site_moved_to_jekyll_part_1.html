<p>I have planned to move my website from wordpress to jekyll based website hosted based on GitHub pages.</p>

<p>I have generated a basic framework for the website. However, I still have to figure out transferring older blogs from https://rameezrehman408.wordpress.com to here (https://rameezrehman408.github.io).
Moreover, I still have to figure out buying a custom domain and linking it to this website.
Thatâ€™s all for now.</p>
