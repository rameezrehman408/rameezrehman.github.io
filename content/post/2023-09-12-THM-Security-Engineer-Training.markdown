TryHackMe is a gamified cyber security training platform that allows users to learn by doing. The platform offers a variety of challenges, from beginner-level to advanced, that teach users the skills they need to become security engineers.

One of the things that makes TryHackMe unique is its hands-on approach to learning. Users are given access to vulnerable machines that they can hack into. This allows them to practice the skills they are learning in a safe and controlled environment.

TryHackMe also offers a variety of learning resources, including tutorials, walkthroughs, and write-ups. These resources can help users learn the theory behind the challenges they are trying to solve.

In addition to the challenges and learning resources, TryHackMe also has a community of users who can help each other learn and grow. This community is a great resource for getting help with challenges, finding new resources, and networking with other security professionals.
