title: Migrating to HUGO from Jekyll

I have heard about the HUGO static site generator, an alternate to Jekyll.
HUGO is quite fast on large sites, uses GO language under the hood compared to Jekyll which uses ruby gems.

I followed the [Chen Hui Jing's Post](https://chenhuijing.com/blog/migrating-from-jekyll-to-hugo/) and [Sarah's Post](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/) for migrating from Jekyll Site to HUGO based site generator.

Before migration, i noticed that I'd have to create a GitHub Action for deploying the site on the github pages, after each update/modification. Another interesting thing to learn in this new age of Cloud and DevOps.
